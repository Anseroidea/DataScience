# Chapter 3 Quiz

*Initialization*
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/slhscs402/Documents/IdeaProjects/DataScience")
conditionplots<-function(x, responsename, predictorname){
  response <- x[[responsename]]
  predictor <- x[[predictorname]]
  linreg <- lm(response~predictor)
  par(mfrow=c(2,2))
  plot(response~predictor, ylab=responsename, xlab=predictorname, main = paste(responsename, "by", predictorname))
  abline(linreg)
  hist(linreg$residuals, xlab="Residuals", main="Histogram of residuals")
  plot(linreg$residuals~linreg$fitted.values, xlab="Fitted values", ylab="Residuals")
  qqnorm(linreg$residuals)
  qqline(linreg$residuals)
}
```

## 1

### a

Using the equation, the model predicts that a student with perfect scores on both the midterm and the project would get a 11.0 + 0.53 * 100 + 1.20 * 30 = 100 on the final

### b

The model predicts that Michael would get a 11.0 + .53 * 87 + 1.2 * 21 = 82.31 on the final. If he got a 87 in reality, his residual would be 80 - 82.31 = -2.31 points. That is, our model overestimates his actual final score by 2.31 points.

## 2

### a

$\beta_1 = 0.53$. Every additional point someone gets on the midterm, the predicted final score would increase by 0.53 points.

### b

$\beta_2 = 1.2$. Every additional point someone gets on the project, the predicted final score would increase by 1.2 points.
